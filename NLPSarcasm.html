          In the Spring of 2020, I had to conduct a research project on sarcasm for my natural language processing class. We all know how sarcastic Reddit posters can be, so I made it my goal to study Reddit subs. In my project I mine, analyze, and mathmatically model Reddit comments and their probability of being sarcastic. *Code that is commented out is commented out due to decreasing the accuracy of our model.
