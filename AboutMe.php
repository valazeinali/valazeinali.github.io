      <p> My name is Vala Zeinali and my parents and I immigrated to the
	    United States in 2003 from Iran. I was 3 at the time of our arival. My 
		chilhood was not like the other kids. My entire K-12 experience was
		attempting to assimilate to the standard "normal" of the US culture. 
	  
	  <br> </p>
	    <p>After a life threatining condition in the 9th grade, I realized 
		  what really mattered in life. It wasn't trying to be like the other kids, doing self hummiliating things for popularity, or buying nike elites to look cool. 
		  What really mattered was being who I was made to be and finding my purpose in life. </p>
