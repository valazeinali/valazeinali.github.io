          I am currently working on building a 13f web scraper and finding the top 5 held positions in the top 100 asset managers. I want to compare the returns of the top 5 positions (position size) for these 100 asset managers. I then want to compare the return % of the top 5 (position size) to the return % of rest of the portfolio. I will run a t-test for a difference of two means to see if the top 5 positions at these 100 funds return higher % than the rest of the portfolio. With this knowledge we can see if there is a correlation between position size (relative to AUM) and return %. In short, we would try to answer the question that the top 5 positions return more % than the complement.

          This Fall I begin my Masters at Dartmouth. Before I start the internship, I will have taken over 16 courses on machine learning, statistics, probability, and also MBA classes at Tuck. During my undergrad I learned a lot and was able to experience some awesome research project for both academia and industry. I will only learn more at Dartmouth and will get even more amazing experiences there.

          I will continue updating the website with the projects I do during my Masters, both academic and for fun.
